# odin-cs_recursion

This is the twelfth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/06) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as iteration and recursion to build three functions to tackle with fibonacci and mergeSort problems respectively. With advices in Assignment of the project, I try different methods to create arrays with fibonacci numbers inside in `fibonacci.js`. I also integrate two related functions to mergeSort arrays with numbers in `mergeSort.js`. Futhermore, I use Node.js command environment to run and debug my functions. This activity strengthens my skills in Node.js and JavaScript.
